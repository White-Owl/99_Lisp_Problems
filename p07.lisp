;;; Flatten a nested list structure.
;;;    Transform a list, possibly holding lists as elements into a `flat' list by replacing each list with its elements (recursively).
;;;
;;;    Example:
;;;    * (my-flatten '(a (b (c d) e)))
;;;    (A B C D E)
;;;
;;;    Hint: Use the predefined functions list and append.
